## User story
1. As a user, i want to see the empty board displayed when i load the browser.
2. Click on an empty cell to make my move, marking it with my symbol (X or O).
3. Alternate turns between Player X and Player O automatically after each move.
4. Be able to clearly see whose turn it is after each move to keep track of the game.
5. Ensure that a marked cell cannot be clicked again, so the integrity of the game is maintained.
6. Be notified when there is a winner if I successfully get three Xs or Os in a row, column, or diagonal.
7. Be notified of a tie if all cells are filled and there is no winner, so the game concludes properly.
8. Click a "Reset Game" button at any time to clear the board and restart the game from scratch, beginning with Player Xâ€™s turn.
### Level Up
9. Play multiple rounds in a session, where the game automatically resets after each round (win or tie), and I can continue playing without clicking "Reset Game."
10. See a scoreboard that keeps track of the number of wins for both Player X and Player O, and the number of ties.
11. Be able to reset both the board and the scores by clicking a "Reset Scoreboard" button, so I can start a fresh game session with a cleared scoreboard.
